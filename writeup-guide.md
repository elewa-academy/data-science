A quick outline for a finished project write-up.  Your projects should include all of these sections.

## Learning Objectives

What do you want to focus on this time around?  It could be the visualization, or Pandas, or piece of the process.  What's important is that you choose _one_ skill, tool, or techique you want to work on the most and then go into depth on that part of the project.

Fill this out before you begin as a promise to yourself.

---

## Scenario

Clearly define and explain the scenario of your project.  This includes:
* The Question - include clear criteria for what constitutes an answer!
* The Domain
* The Context
* The Audience
* The Data

It is never a waste of time to spend more time investigating and learning your scenario.

Complete this step before moving on to the analysis.

## Analysis

__Analyze your data__
* Investigate your data, it's history, and it's domain.
* Plan a strategy for how you will use the given data to address your question

__Run your analysis__
* Lay out a technical plan for your data analysis. What methods will you use and why?
* Execute your analysis, be sure to thoroughly document each step of the process.  Ideally, someone with a little less experience than you should be able to follow and understand your analysis.

## Results

__Conclusions__
* How does the data answer your question?  Tie this back directly to the criteria you established in the Scenario.
