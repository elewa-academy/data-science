# Workshop 1: Are we safe?




Chose ONE dimension of this data-set of [near-earth objects](https://data.nasa.gov/resource/2vr3-k9wn.json) to estimate how safe we really are.  To do this you will:  
1. Question the data.
2. Determine which single dimension of data is most relevant to this question.
3. Establish safety thresholds: 
    * ie. Is 1000 objects within 1000 miles a meaningful danger threshold?
4. Clean the dataset down to only that dimension.
5. Do basic pre-analysis data visualization.
6. Run the cleaned data set through your std module.
7. Try to make an inference about the total population of near-earth objects based on your measurements.
8. Present your findings to each other, including your recommended actions based on your conclusions.

## mini practice project

__Project 1:__

Part 1:
1. Split into groups.  
2. I'll give each group a small set of data
3. Compute the mean & std of the data I give you by hand.
4. Estimate the mean and std of my complete data set.

Part 2: 
1. Share your data sets with all the groups.
2. Using everyone's data, do what you did in part 1.
