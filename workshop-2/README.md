## Here's the plan

__Part 1__

Critique together any projects you have worked on over the last two weeks.  You can put links to your work [right here](https://github.com/elewa-academy/data-science/issues/1)

---

__Part 2__

Practice starting projects from nothing.  I will prepare 4 scenarios to investigate together (depending on time). 

We'll go as far as the _Scenario_ section from the [write-up guide](https://github.com/elewa-academy/data-science/blob/master/writeup-guide.md).
